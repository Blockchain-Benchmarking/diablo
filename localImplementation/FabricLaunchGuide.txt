HOW TO RUN FABRIC

If you're feeling lost and need something precise, you may follow the official guidelines of Hyperledger Fabric by using 
this link for the prerequesites : https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/prereqs.html

And then this link to install the Hyperledger Fabric binaries : https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/install.html

I will try to make it as clear and concise as possible without reading the Hyperledger Fabric guidelines.


Prerequesites :

- git
- latest version of cURL
- latest version of docker and docker-compose

Installation of binaries and docker images :

1. Go to a location on your machine where you want to place the fabric-samples directory

2. run the following command : curl -sSL https://bit.ly/2ysbOFE | bash -s
   
This command will perform the followings steps :


    a.If needed, clone the hyperledger/fabric-samples repository
    b.Checkout the appropriate version tag
    c.Install the Hyperledger Fabric platform-specific binaries and config files for the version specified into the /bin and /config directories of fabric-samples
    d.Download the Hyperledger Fabric docker images for the version specified

3. Add the bin folder of the fabric-samples to your path
    
    a. To do this, you will need to go ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc and add the following line at the end : 
    export PATH=$PATH:<full path of the directory where you did the installation>/fabric-samples/bin

    b. Check if you added the path correctly by typing in the terminal the single word : orderer 
    
        If you get the following message "failed to parse config:  Error reading configuration: Unsupported Config Type ""
        Congratulations, you added the path correctly !

4. Go to diablo-benchmark/localImplementation/artifacts/channel and run the following command : ./create-artifacts.sh


5. Go to diablo-benchmark/localImplementation/artifacts and run the following command : ./ccp-generate.sh


ATTENTION : Once you have installed the binaries, docker images and the artifacts once, you will not need to redo the steps above to run the local network



RUNNING THE LOCAL FABRIC NETWORK :

1. If you have run the local network before, please follow thoses steps to bring the network down correctly, otherwise skip this:

    a. Go to diablo-benchmark/localImplementation and run the following command : ./downNetwork.sh


2. Go to diablo-benchmark/localImplementation/artifacts and run the following command : docker-compose up -d 

    This may take a few seconds or minutes if you haven't built the docker images yet, wait until it's done
    

3. Go to diablo-benchmark/localImplementation and run the following command : ./createChannel.sh

    This may take a few seconds once again

4. Now run the following command : ./deployChaincode.sh 

    This may take a few seconds once again



Congratulations, you are done ! You may now run diablo with it or use FabricTester.go to test it.

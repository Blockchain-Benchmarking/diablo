Diablo Benchmark Workload                                               Dec 2020

================================================================================

                           Initial Coin Offering
                             (TENX WORKLOAD)

================================================================================


Description of the workload

    This workload is representative of the request rates observed during the
    Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of the TENX token. This token was launched
    on 24th June 2017 and lasted 7 minutes. The token sale was able to raise
    a collective of 100 million tokens, through a collection of both Bitcoin
    and Ethereum. The workload representation will be based off the Ethereum
    transaction request rate observed during that time.

    ICO duration: 7 minutes
    Contract Function: () "fallback function" - send ether and it will convert
    to the contract.


Experimental Setup:

    Number of Nodes (blockchain): Optimal
    Number of Secondaries: Optimal (Effective Scaling until degradation)
    Number of Threads: Optimal (Effective Scaling until degradation)

    Justification:

        Initially, ICOs were released to the public on public blockchains,
        often through Ethereum or Bitcoin.
        As new blockchains are released, we should aim to find the "optimal"
        environment for handling throughput to the point of degradation.
        It must be noted, that certain closed/permissioned blockchains operate
        under an assumed environment (e.g. already set up consortium of fixed
        numbers), and should be honoured during the testing setup and provided
        in the workload configurations.

Contract:
    The contract to be deployed is a simplification of the Tezos token sale
    contract in [2], modified for ease of deployment in the benchmark, but
    equal function signatures (minus constructor).


Justification:
    In resource [1], the request rate is measured through passive measurement.
    This highlighted the number of requests per minute observed in the P2P
    network messages distribtued in the system.

                    ONLINE PARTS MARKETPLACE

================================================================================


Description of the workload

    Inspired by Hyperledger Fabric use case from Honeywell Aerospace : https://www.hyperledger.org/learn/publications/honeywell-case-study

    Since aviation is a heavily regulated industry, sales require certification from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies.
    Each part must be documented with a complete history of its ownership, use, and repairs.
    Online buying of aircraft pieces in the style of Amazon thus requires trust and we enable this by having a trusted ledger with data integrity which lets us see :

    - The entire lifecycle of a part and all its previous owners
    - Anti counterfeit measures via certification and persistence

    Because aircraft pieces are expensive and large, deals are tend to be made using purchase orders and not card payments.
    For users to be confident in their purchases, every purchase order is stored indefinitely on the ledger to provide traceability

Experimental Setup:

    Number of Nodes (blockchain): ?
    Number of Secondaries: ?
    Number of Threads: ?

    Justification:

        A nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) is a natural model for the arrival process in a queueing model for performance analysis.[2]
        Thus it is an acceptable curve definition for an online marketplace.


    Blockchain Classifications:

        Hyperledger Fabric


Contract:

    The smart contract source code is available in ./chaincode-go

    We will assume every aircraft piece has a unique ID because the aviation world is well regulated. An aircraft piece is defined by its id, description, certification, value and *OWNER*.
    Sellers will post their offerings on the website by adding the aircraft piece in the ledger world state using CreatePart().

    Every time a purchase is made using transferPart(), a purchase order is created and placed on the ledger.
    Purchases are made using transferPart() because we want to be able to follow the entire lifecycle of the part hence it is always transferred from one owner to another.

    When visiting your profile or another user's profile, you want to be able to list all their owned parts.
    This query is done by using QueryPartsByOwner().

Justification:

    From the use case[1]: "Among the critical factors Honeywell needed were low latency, high throughput, and fast send rates."
    As it is an Amazon type marketplace, thoses are legitimate requirements.

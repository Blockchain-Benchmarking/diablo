Diablo Benchmark Workload                                          <<YEAR HERE>>

================================================================================

                        Twitter Castle In The Sky

Description of the workload

    This workload mimics the request rate observed with Twitter in August 2013,
    when the airing of "Castle In The Sky" [1] was broadcast in Japan. This
    workload highlights the potential for a system to cope with such high
    amounts of traffic.

Experimental Setup:

    Number of Nodes (blockchain):
    Number of Secondaries:
    Number of Threads

    Justification:

        As this workload is presented as a stress test, this workload should
        be observed with ordinary conditions of that blockchain. For a
        permissionless blockchain that is designed for several nodes running
        a BFT consensus, it should be the number stated in that design, or,
        optimal conditions if this is an exploratory benchmark to find
        optimality.

Justification:

    The twitter workload was provided from the data observed during the
    event, at which twitter reached the highest "tweet per second" request
    rate of 143,199 for one second. The average tweet per second observed
    in twitter is approximately 5,700 - making this anomaly an event that
    stress tested the system. [2]

    A blockchain platform that may have traffic similar to that of twitter
    must cope with such anomalous events, whereby this benchmark provides
    a perfect stress test and observation of latency.

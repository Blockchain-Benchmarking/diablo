Diablo Benchmark Workload                                               Dec 2020

================================================================================

                           Initial Coin Offering
                             (TENX WORKLOAD)

================================================================================


Description of the workload

    This workload is representative of the request rates observed during the
    Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of the TENX token. This token was launched
    on 24th June 2017 and lasted 7 minutes. The token sale was able to raise
    a collective of 100 million tokens, through a collection of both Bitcoin
    and Ethereum. The workload representation will be based off the Ethereum
    transaction request rate observed during that time.

    ICO duration: 7 minutes
    Contract Function: () "fallback function" or "receive()" - send ether and
    it will convert to the tokens for the token sale.


Experimental Setup:

    Number of Nodes (blockchain): Optimal
    Number of Secondaries: Optimal (Effective Scaling until degradation)
    Number of Threads: Optimal (Effective Scaling until degradation)

    Justification:

        Initially, ICOs were released to the public on public blockchains,
        often through Ethereum or Bitcoin.
        As new blockchains are released, we should aim to find the "optimal"
        environment for handling throughput to the point of degradation for
        the blockchain available.
        The blockchains MUST support smart-contract like functionality and
        are classified to partake in environments where IPO/ICOs may occur.
        It must be noted, that certain closed/permissioned blockchains operate
        under an assumed environment (e.g. already set up consortium of fixed
        numbers), and should be honoured during the testing setup and provided
        in the workload configurations.

    Blockchain Classifications:

        Ethereum-based VM supporting contracts.
            Ethereum POA
            Quorum
            Burrow
            Ether/Tendermint
            Mulga Chain

Contract:

    The deployed contract will be taken directly from the TenX token sale
    contract as listed on the Etherscan website [2] and modified for simplicity
    in the benchmark. The contract will be a modified version that contains
    the same core functions, with minimal changes.
    The highlighted changes can be found in the ".diff" file in the
    "eth-solidity" folder.


Justification:
    In resource [1], the request rate is measured through passive measurement.
    This highlighted the number of requests per minute observed in the P2P
    network messages distribtued in the system. The rate of sending peaks
    when the ICO time is reached, with maximal sends, and slowly tapers off
    in the 7 minutes to finally settle at the base transaction request rate.

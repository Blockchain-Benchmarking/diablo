Description of the workload

    <<The description of the workload should provide a human-readable
    description of why this workload exists, and the fundamental principle that
    it is based on. Diablo workloads are heavily tied with real-world
    applications, so this must have some information on the real-world
    application.>>

Experimental Setup:

    Number of Nodes (blockchain):
    Number of Secondaries:
    Number of Threads

    Justification:

        <<The justification MUST describe information about why the number of
        nodes/secondaries/threads exist. In some cases, these are tailored
        specifically for a specific workload that requires exact number of
        nodes and clients.>>


    Blockchain Classicitaions:

        <<List supported blockchains for this workload>>

Contract:

    <<Describe the contract and the required code.>>

Justification:

    <<Justification of the workload with reference to any related resources>>

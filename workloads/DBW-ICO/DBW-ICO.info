Diablo Benchmark Workload                                               Dec 2020

================================================================================

                           Initial Coin Offering
                              (TENX WORKLOAD)

================================================================================


Description of the workload

    This workload represents the request rates observed during an Initial Coin
    Offering (ICO) presented in the Ethereum Mainnet. The ICO offers a unique
    request environment where high requests are made to secure a limited number
    of coins, similar to a public offering observed by companies in an IPO.
    These events act as a natural stress on the blockchain network, and have
    been observed multiple times.
    By benchmarking with this workload, we can observe the blockchain's ability
    to handle high request rates with a curve equivalent to that seen in an
    ICO.

Justification:
    In resource [1], the request rate is measured through passive measurement.
    This highlighted the number of requests per minute observed in the P2P
    network messages distribtued in the system.

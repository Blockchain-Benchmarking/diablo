Experimental Setup:

    Number of Nodes (blockchain): < 1
    Number of Secondaries: < 1
    Number of Threads: <= 1

    Justification:

     Here the idea is to showcase that even a constant flow of transactions can lead to a denial of service on Fabric.


    Blockchain Classifications:

        Hyperledger Fabric


Contract:

    The smart contract source code is available in ./chaincode-go

    The contract will be very simple and consist of creating assets and modifying those assets.

Justification:

    *insert wanting to showcase limitations of Fabric*
